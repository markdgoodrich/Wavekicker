Ideas and brainstorming

Top-down
Missing waves results in tide coming in
	- OR "Tides Coming in!" challenge portion
Fake-out waves
	- random chance for fake out wave
	- 

Color changing sand

Waves consequences

	- Crabs
	- Turtles

---------------------------------
Movement slows in deeper water


Surface.get_at((x, y)): return Color
pygame.Surface.get_at
	get the color value at a single pixel

screen = pygame.display.set_mode(size)

pixel = screen.get_at(pygame.mouse.get_pos()) #gets the pixel on the screen surface

With every update:
	Check players position
	Get color from player's position
	If yellow: normal speed
	elif light blue: less speed

dark blue: 	(2, 64, 86, 255)
light blue: 	(35, 81, 215, 255)
sand: 		(47, 159, 200, 255)
---------------------------------

Have Waves coming in

	Draw waves
	Have their movements
		Dynamic speed?
		move top-Down
	Collision with player
		if player kicks, wave breaks
		Otherwise, player stumbles
